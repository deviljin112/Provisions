# Provisions

Provisioning is derived from providing and supplying something. For example, Provisioning for food or water. In Vagrant provides our Virtual Machine with instructions, variables, files, and folders.

This means we can set up a machine to a specific state when initialized.

## Upload a single file to VM

`vagrant upload <path/to/file>`

This uploads single file to the machine.
